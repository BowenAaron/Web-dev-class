    <h2>Where I'm From:</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Georgia and grew up in and around Lagrange. I've lived here my whole life and have not
        ventured out from it too much. I did spend a few years in Alabama and I lived in Ohio for about a year and a
        half.</p>
    <h2>My Hobbies Include:</h2>
    <p>When I was pretty young I enjoyed writing fiction. I wrote a 15 page story for my fourth grade class and I knew
        then it was something I enjoyed. Another hobby of mine includes drawing. I got into drawing when I was in sixth
        grade after a friend of mine had lent me a comic they had. As for now coding has been a big interest of mine but
        I never knew the full knowledge of it. A friend of mine helped me code a bot for our discord and I've been
        wanting to learn more about it.</p>
    <h2>These are My Current Goals:</h2>
    <p>I want to earn skills for a field of work that can help me find a job that can allow me to work anywhere in the
        world. This is important to me because I want to be living in a different country in the next 5 years. It's been
        a dream of mine to travel but traveling is not cheap. If I can travel and it not affect my work, then I would
        consider that goal fulfilled.</p>
